Many cuts of the Ameglian Major Cow were available, such as shoulder braised in white wine sauce, grain fed rump, casserole, liver and steaks.

    Many beverages were available at the restaurant including water, mineral water, insidious wines,[5] champagne[6] and Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters. However, tea was not available.
    
    However, there was a sweet trolley and a fine selection of Aldebaran liqueurs available.`
